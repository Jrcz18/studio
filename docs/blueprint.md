# **App Name**: Unified Booker

## Core Features:

- Calendar Integration: Synchronize booking information across multiple platforms using iCal URLs. Supports Airbnb, Booking.com, and direct bookings. Users will provide links to their respective external calendars, and the application will monitor these calendars, importing new bookings and logging conflicts in the event of overlapping dates across calendars.
- Unit Management: Manage up to 3 rental units, each with its own calendar and settings.
- Discord Bot Integration: Connect a Discord bot to receive notifications for new bookings, cancellations, and booking summaries.
- Smart Conflict Detection: The application will employ a tool which detects potential booking conflicts across multiple calendars. It automatically sends alerts to the user, providing options to resolve conflicts or manually override them.
- Booking Summary: Send daily, weekly or monthly summary of bookings, pricing and availability status. Bookings include booking platform, start/end date, revenue generated and cleaning schedule. Pricing will dynamically increase on dates that has an uptick of search rate and dynamically reduce when low
- User Authentication: Secure user authentication to manage units and calendar settings.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated blue (#5F9EA0) evoking reliability and tranquility, suitable for a booking app focused on seamless integration and organization.
- Background color: Very light cyan (#E0FFFF), near-white but tinted for softness, providing a clean, calm backdrop that enhances readability and focus.
- Accent color: Purple (#800080), which offers a contrast to the blue hues and provides clear affordances for CTAs and important actions.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text; ensures elegance and readability for different content types.
- Use clear, minimalistic icons to represent different booking platforms, unit types, and notification settings.
- Implement a clean and intuitive layout with a master calendar view. Ensure easy navigation between units and booking details.
- Subtle transitions and animations when navigating between calendars and viewing booking details to enhance user experience.
